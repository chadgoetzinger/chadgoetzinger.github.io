      <h2>About</h2>
      <img src="images/goe.JPG" alt="picture" width="110" height="110">
      <p>Experienced with graphics design, illustration and sign painting. 

      Excellent at first fully understanding the customers ideas about the project, then using that understanding to create something that is visually compelling and accomplishes the goal. 

      With branding I really enjoy translating what the customer needs to say into something that visually communicates the message; leveraging composition, color, and over all design to provide a certain feel that resonates with the organization and their customers.

      I have always had a passion for illustration, art and visual design. Creative visualization and making varying content and subjects into art comes really easily to me. I continually research and study other experts design concepts, use of perspective, textures, depth and how artists tell a story to the viewer through visual communication.</p>
